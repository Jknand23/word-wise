# Active Context: Student Progress Tracking

## Current Focus
Implementing simple student progress tracking and visualization on the dashboard with two core features:

### ✅ **Feature 1: Writing Consistency**
- Weekly writing goal setting (user-customizable)
- Progress tracking with visual progress bars
- Documents created this week counter
- **Daily login streak tracking** - shows consecutive days user has logged in
- Goal achievement notifications

### ✅ **Feature 2: Quality Improvement**
- Error rate tracking per 100 words (much more meaningful than absolute counts)
- Trend analysis comparing recent vs. previous documents
- Personal best tracking
- Quality improvement visualization

## What's Been Implemented

### Services Created
- **`progressService.ts`**: Core service handling all progress calculations
  - Weekly document counting
  - Quality metrics calculation (error rate per 100 words)
  - Trend analysis (recent 5 vs. previous 5 documents)
  - Firebase integration for data persistence

### State Management
- **`progressStore.ts`**: Zustand store for progress data
  - Progress data loading and caching
  - Weekly goal setting
  - Error handling

### UI Components
- **`ProgressCards.tsx`**: Dashboard components displaying:
  - Weekly writing goal with segmented progress bar
  - Quality metrics with trend indicators
  - Goal editing modal
  - Personal best achievements

### Data Structure
- **`userProgressSettings`** collection: User's weekly goals, last login date, current streak
- **`documentQualityMetrics`** collection: Per-document quality data
- Firebase security rules for progress data access

### Integration Points
- **Dashboard**: Progress cards integrated above Quick Actions
- **DocumentEditor**: Automatic quality metrics tracking when suggestions are received
- **Firestore**: New collections with proper security rules

## Current Status
- ✅ Core services implemented
- ✅ UI components created
- ✅ Dashboard integration complete
- ✅ Automatic quality tracking in document editor
- ✅ Firebase security rules updated
- ✅ Basic error handling

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete flow with real data
2. Add loading states for better UX  
3. ✅ ~~Consider adding streak calculation~~ **COMPLETED: Daily login streak implemented**
4. Validate metric calculations are accurate
5. Add user onboarding for goal setting

## Technical Notes
- Error rate calculated as (spelling + grammar errors) / word count * 100
- Trend analysis requires minimum 5 documents for meaningful comparison
- Weekly tracking uses Sunday as start of week
- **Streak Logic**: Increments on consecutive daily logins, resets to 0 if user skips a day
- **Login Detection**: Automatically tracked when dashboard loads progress data
- Quality metrics stored per document for historical analysis
- Graceful fallbacks when insufficient data exists

## User Experience
- Simple and encouraging progress visualization
- Non-overwhelming metrics focused on improvement
- Easy goal customization via settings modal
- Clear visual feedback on progress and achievements
